# Enhanced Transfer Panel - Implementation Notes

## Overview
This implementation enhances the ZymTools Google Drive Uploader with individual file tracking, granular error handling, and retry capabilities for folder uploads.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Individual File Tracking
- **FileTransferItem Class**: New class to represent individual files within folder transfers
- **Child File Management**: TransferItem now maintains a collection of child files for folder transfers
- **Per-File Status**: Each file has its own status (pending, in-progress, completed, error)
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual file progress is tracked and aggregated for folder-level progress

### 2. Enhanced Transfer Panel UI
- **Expandable Tree View**: Folders can be expanded to show individual file status
- **Hierarchical Display**: Clear visual distinction between folders and their contained files
- **Detailed Progress**: Shows both individual file progress and overall folder progress
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status indicators for easy visual assessment

### 3. Error Tracking Panel
- **Dedicated Error Panel**: Separate panel shows only files that failed
- **Error Details**: Full error messages with tooltips for detailed information
- **Retry Tracking**: Shows number of retry attempts for each failed file
- **Bulk Operations**: Option to retry all failed files at once

### 4. Retry Mechanism
- **Individual File Retry**: Retry only specific failed files, not entire folders
- **Retry Counter**: Track number of retry attempts per file
- **Smart Retry**: Failed files are marked for retry while successful files remain untouched
- **Context Menu**: Right-click options for individual file actions

### 5. Duplicate Detection
- **Pre-Upload Check**: Files are checked for existence before upload
- **Skip Existing Files**: Files that already exist are marked as completed and skipped
- **Visual Indication**: Skipped files are clearly marked in the UI

### 6. Enhanced Statistics
- **File Count Tracking**: Shows number of files completed vs. total
- **Error Count Display**: Separate counter for failed files
- **Overall Progress**: Folder progress reflects individual file completion
- **Speed Calculation**: Transfer speeds calculated based on individual file progress

## Technical Implementation

### Models (models/transfer_models.py)
- `FileTransferItem`: Represents individual files with status, progress, and error tracking
- `TransferItem`: Enhanced with child file management and aggregated progress calculation
- `TransferManager`: New methods for file-level operations and retry management
- `TransferListModel`: Updated to display hierarchical file structure

### Views (views/transfer_view.py)
- `TransferTreeView`: Enhanced tree view with expand/collapse functionality
- `ErrorFilesWidget`: New widget for error tracking and retry operations
- `TransferPanel`: Updated with error panel and enhanced toolbar

### Threads (threads/transfer_threads.py)
- `SafeFolderUploadThread`: Enhanced to track individual files during upload
- Individual file status updates during upload process
- Duplicate detection integration
- Enhanced error handling per file

### Main Window (views/main_window.py)
- `retry_failed_files()`: New method to handle retry requests
- Signal connections for retry functionality
- Integration with enhanced transfer panel

## Usage

### For End Users
1. **Monitor Individual Files**: Expand folder transfers to see which specific files are uploading
2. **Handle Errors Efficiently**: View failed files in the error panel with detailed error messages
3. **Retry Failed Files**: Use right-click context menu or error panel buttons to retry only failed files
4. **Track Progress**: See both file-level and folder-level progress indicators
5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Files that already exist are automatically skipped

### For Developers
1. **File Tracking**: Use `TransferManager.add_file_to_transfer()` to add files to folder transfers
2. **Status Updates**: Use `TransferManager.update_file_status_in_transfer()` for file-level status updates
3. **Error Handling**: Individual file errors don't affect the entire folder transfer
4. **Retry Logic**: Use `TransferManager.retry_failed_files()` to mark files for retry

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: Users can see exactly which files are uploading, completed, or failed
2. **Efficient Error Recovery**: Only failed files need to be retried, saving time and bandwidth
3. **Reduced Frustration**: Clear error messages and easy retry options improve user experience
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Duplicate detection prevents unnecessary re-uploads
5. **Detailed Feedback**: Comprehensive progress and status information for better user understanding

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality is preserved
- Existing single file uploads work unchanged
- Folder uploads now provide enhanced tracking but maintain the same interface
- No breaking changes to the public API

## Future Enhancements

- Pause/resume individual file transfers
- Priority-based transfer ordering
- Advanced filtering and search in transfer lists
- Export transfer logs and error reports
- Bandwidth throttling per file or folder
